To practice - (install git or MobaXterm)

Create a Linux machine in AWS cloud 

1. Create an AWS account 
2. wait for the account to get activated 
3. Search for EC2 service -> Goto Instances -> Launch Instances 
	a. Give a name to the machine (instance)
	b. Choose the OS type (AMI type)
	c. Create and save the Key Pair to login 
4. Create an instance 

In Linux commands are case-sensitive 

A folder is called a Directory in Linux

Know your current path/location 
    pwd - present working directory 

To list files and directories 
     command: ls 
     To list with details (long format): ls -l
     To list with creation time sorted (recent at the top): ls -t
     To list reverse order: ls -r
     All the above together: ls -lrt (OR) ll
       
switch/change to a folder/Directory in Linux (change directory - cd)
    command: cd  
    Syntax: cd <path>/<location>
    example: 1. To change to a Directory in the current location
    		cd test 

create a directory/folder in Linux (make directory - mkdir)
    command: mkdir 
    To create a directory: mkdir <directory_name>
    		example: mkdir test
    To create multiple directories: mkdir <directory_name> <directory_name1> <directory_name2> ..... <directory_name>
    		note: directory names with space separated	
    		example: mkdir test test1 test2 ...	

Delete files/directories (rm)

Use the rm command to delete files and directories. But rm cannot simply delete a directory. Use “rm -r” to delete a directory. In this case, it deletes both the folder and the files in it.
     To remove/delete a file 	
	rm file_name 
     To remove/delete a Directory	
	rm -r directory

Linux path 
  Always Linux path is separate with / 	
   . -> current directory 
   .. -> one step back / Previous one directory 
   ../.. -> Previous two directory

To create an empty file (touch)
    if the file does not exist, the touch command will create an empty file.
    If the file already exists, the touch command will alter the file timestamp to recent.
	touch <file_name>
To display/print the contents of files (cat)
	cat command (short for “concatenate“) allows us to create single or multiple files, view contain
	of a file, concatenate files, and redirect output in the terminal or files.
		cat <file_name>
